# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Version 5

This is the fifth iteration of my personal portfolio, designed to showcase who I am, what I build, and where to find me online. It's built using **Next.js** and styled with **TailwindCSS**, and it's hosted seamlessly on **Vercel** for fast, reliable performance.

## 📌 Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a responsive and sleek UI.
- **Custom Links Page**: A `/links` page replaces third-party tools like Linktree, giving me full control over my branding.
- **Project Showcases**: Clean and simple project section to highlight what I’m working on.
- **Social Connections**: Easily access my social platforms through the homepage or `/links`.
- **Fast & Reliable Hosting**: Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for continuous deployment and fast global delivery.
- **Future-Proof**: The site will evolve to host a mix of **useless/fun websites** and genuinely **useful web apps** I build along the way.
